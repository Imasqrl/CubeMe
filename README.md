# CubeMe
Polygons with text from a data source written to different faces. 
I would like to write code that will allow me to make 3D objects with faces (like cubes) and add text from specific fields to specific faces.
One potential application of this project is as a custom data visualization usable in programs like Power BI. 
Another application for this is in virtual environments where the polygons can be stacked and moved around by a user.
Right now this is an aspiration and I'm learning as I go. This is my first real code project!
